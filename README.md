# Calculator

My project for the [Build a JavaScript Calculator challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) as part of the curriculum for the Front End Development Certification on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## User Stories
1. I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.
3. I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
